									<h2>Mana Hazard</h2>
									<h3>Game created in a team of 6 in 48h during a Game Jam</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									During my first Game Jam, the imposed subject was “When the Magic Goes Wrong” with Management / Strategy / Multiplayer as the game style.
									Our team was made up of beginners; it was the first Game Jam for all of us.
									Initially, we decided to create a turn-based tactical game like XCOM, but due to the short time we had, we decided to pivot to a JRPG-style turn-based fighting game.
								</p>
								<a href="#" class="bordered-feature-image"><img src="images/ManaHazard.png" alt="Mana Hazard Screenshot" /></a>
								<p>
									The game consists of turn-based combat between two players, each with 3 characters.
									Each spell cast increases an overall mana gauge; the higher the gauge, the greater the risk of negative repercussions for anyone who dares to cast a spell.
									At the start of the game, players alternately select their characters one by one. The fight continues until all characters on one side are defeated.

								<p>
									Due to time constraints, we were unable to balance the game, and animations were not implemented. Some items remained as placeholders. The project is playable and stable but difficult to understand.
									We used Unity as the engine to create the game with free assets.
									This experience was very rewarding and taught me to better manage my time in a game jam while also deepening my knowledge of Unity.
